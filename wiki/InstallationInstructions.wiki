Two downloads are available - 

For windows, download the zip file and unzip it in a location of your choice. In the folder that is created you will find 'transpoint.exe'. Clicking on this will launch the application. You can create a shortcut from this to the desktop to launch it easily. Sorry, no installer yet for Windows.

For Linux, download the .tar.gz archive and extract it in a temporary location. You can run the transpoint.py script from this folder if you dont want to install. Otherwise, navigate to the folder in the terminal and type 'python install.py install'. 
Requirements are :
  # Python (already present in most linux distros)
  # Python Imaging Library
  # wxPython
